:: Welcome to the Consciously Chaotic Creation Project! ::


The mission of this project is to illustrate how truely random information
can be used to:

> Secure entire servers' communications with a single true random ledger.
> Generate 2D graphics and 3D models via geometric algorithms.
> Aid in creating games and game servers that are truely fair to all players.

The philosophy being that if random information is going to be used at some
point along the service train, that it would be of great benefit to start
with the random key and 'unrandom' it. You start with the key and build the
'lock' around it, the input is the output, and it is wildly compressed.

Observe the following flow diagram:

><1.SEEK> >> <2.TRACK> >> <3.SPOOL> >> <4.WEAVE> >> <5.OUTPUT>

1. Seek out random information either from memory or quantum observations.

2. Track it by saving the random key. This is best if saved in a circular
manner: i.e. if your storage device fills you can 'turn around' and use the
key seeking in the opposite direction until you expand storage capacity, or
use the same key forever if it is large enough and security is not paramount.

3. Spool the bits into different algorithms (00, 01, 10, 11 for quaternary).

4. Weave the algorithms' outputs into the desired form. This can either
be a combination of pseudo-random algorithms with a secret sequence for
encryption purposes, or geometric algorithms for 'growing' either 2D or 3D
graphics. Note that the 'save-file' is the tracked random key, the spooling
and weaving are the 'secret' or 'seed.'

5. If graphical: judge the output, and if you don't like it then repeat [4]
until you do. If you do like it, but it's not quite right, try a different
window of the random key. If crypto: encrypt your data with the generated
binary. Keep the tracked key secure, but if it is compromised the adversary
will still need to know how the binary was spooled into the sequence of
pseudo-random algorithms you chose in order to decrypt your files.



:: Assets ::


: Random Information :

The 'RandomNumbers' binary was downloaded from https://www.random.org/bytes/


: C Files :

'DOCTOR_ENT.c' seeks from the beginning of 'RandomNumbers' and passes the 0's
and 1's through what is essentially a decision tree of geometric algorithms
to generate 'EXAMPLE.svg'

Additional C files using this technique are welcome in the directory
'Community Contributions'!


: SVG Files :

The 'Circle_One.svg' file is included as the barebones SVG file with a
10px circle in the centre used to find dimensions necessary for geometric
calculations, as well as the necessary semantics for 'DOCTOR_ENT.c' to output.
The dimensions are what they are so that this graphic can be printed onto my
business card.

'EXAMPLE.svg' is the output of 'DOCTOR_ENT.c', Please study these files
together and contribute your own consciously chaotic creations in the
'Community Contributions' directory! For SVG, Simply take your 'EXAMPLE.svg'
and add it where the comment is in 'Circle_One.svg'.
